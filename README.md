# RCB-magazine

In 2013 created RCB magazine app from scratch. Although it had nothing to do with programming, because our company bought Adobe DPS lisense (its a platform for moving periodicals into App Store and Google Play), I got experience with Apple developer account, how to submit app in appstore & google play, how create subscription, in addition to creating UI adapted to Ipad and Android tablets.

Since then I interested in app developing.
